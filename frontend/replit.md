### Production
- **Frontend**: Vite build generates static assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code for Node.js execution
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Static Assets**: Served directly by Express in production

### Build Process

2. Backend code bundled with ESBuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Database migrations applied via Drizzle Kit
4. Single Node.js process serves both API and static assets

The application is designed for easy deployment on platforms like Replit, with automatic environment detection and appropriate middleware configuration for development vs production environments.
