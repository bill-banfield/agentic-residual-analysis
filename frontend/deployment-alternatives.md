# Deployment Alternatives for Full-Stack Application

## The Problem with AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is designed for **static sites** and **serverless functions**, not full Express.js applications. Your app needs a running Node.js server for the webhook proxy endpoints.

## Recommended Platforms ⭐

### 1. **Vercel** (Easiest Migration)
- ✅ Supports Node.js API routes
- ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Built-in environment variables
- ✅ Free tier available

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 2. **Railway** (Full Node.js Support)
- ✅ Full Node.js application support
- ✅ PostgreSQL database included
- ✅ Simple deployment
- ✅ Great for Express.js apps

**Setup:**
1. Connect GitHub repo to Railway
2. Add environment variables
3. Auto-deploys on git push

### 3. **Render** (Similar to Heroku)
- ✅ Free tier with full Node.js support
- ✅ PostgreSQL database available
- ✅ GitHub integration
- ✅ Zero configuration needed

### 4. **Heroku** (Traditional Choice)
- ✅ Mature platform
- ✅ PostgreSQL add-on
- ✅ Extensive documentation
- ⚠️ No free tier anymore

## Quick Migration Steps

### For Vercel:
1. Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/public/**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Railway:
1. Add `railway.toml`:
```toml
[build]
command = "npm run build"

[start]
command = "node dist/index.js"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

## Current Status

- **Replit**: ✅ Working (webhook proxy functional)
- **AWS Amplify**: ❌ Static only (no backend API)
- **Need**: Platform with Node.js server support

## Recommendation

**Deploy to Railway or Vercel** for the easiest migration with full functionality. Both support your current architecture without changes.

Would you like me to prepare deployment configs for any of these platforms?
