# AWS Amplify Deployment Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Connection During Build
**Problem**: AWS Amplify build was failing because the application tried to connect to PostgreSQL during the build process.

**Solution**: 
- Created `server/env.ts` to detect build environment
- Modified database initialization to skip during build
- Added placeholder DATABASE_URL for build process

### 2. Missing Database Schema Exports
**Problem**: Storage interface was importing non-existent database table exports.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper Drizzle table definitions to `shared/schema.ts`
- Exported required User types for storage compatibility
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

### 3. Redis Initialization During Build
**Problem**: Redis connection was attempted during build when not needed.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `initRedis()` to skip during build environment
- Added build detection in environment configuration
- Maintained fallback memory cache for all environments

### 4. Build Environment Configuration
**Problem**: AWS Amplify didn't have proper environment variable handling.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `amplify.yml` with proper environment variables
- Added build-safe DATABASE_URL fallback
- Improved build logging and error handling

## Files Modified

1. **shared/schema.ts** - Added database table definitions
2. **server/env.ts** - New environment configuration utility
3. **server/index.ts** - Build-safe service initialization
4. **server/redis.ts** - Skip Redis during build
5. **amplify.yml** - Improved build configuration
6. **scripts/build-amplify.js** - Custom AWS build script

## Environment Variables Required

For AWS Amplify Console → Environment Variables:

```bash
# Required for runtime
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional for caching
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port
```

## Build Process

The updated build process:
1. Detects AWS Amplify environment
2. Sets build-safe placeholder values
3. Skips database/Redis connections during build
4. Generates both frontend and backend artifacts
5. Validates build output

## Testing

Local build test with AWS environment:
```bash
export AWS_BUILD=true
export NODE_ENV=production
npm run build
```

Should complete successfully without database connection.

## Latest Fix - Frontend Definition Error

### Problem
AWS Amplify was failing with "CustomerError: Missing frontend definition in buildspec"

### Solution
Updated `amplify.yml` to include both `frontend` and `backend` sections:
- Frontend builds and serves static assets from `dist/public`
- Backend provides the server bundle at `dist/index.js`
- Proper artifact configuration for AWS Amplify expectations

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Ensure environment variables are set in AWS Amplify Console:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
3. Trigger new deployment
4. Monitor build logs for success

## Build Verification

Local build test confirms:
- ✅ Frontend: `dist/public/` with index.html and assets (872.50 kB)
- ✅ Backend: `dist/index.js` server bundle (17.9kB)
- ✅ No database connection during build
- ✅ Environment variables handled correctly

The application will now build successfully on AWS Amplify while maintaining full functionality in runtime environments.
