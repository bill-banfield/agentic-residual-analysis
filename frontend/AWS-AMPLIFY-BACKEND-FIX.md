# AWS Amplify Backend API Fix

## Problem Identified üîç

Your AWS Amplify deployment is configured as a **static frontend only**, but your application requires a **backend API server** to handle the webhook proxy endpoints.

### Evidence:
1. **AWS Error**: Returns 404 with HTML error page when trying to access `/api/webhook-proxy`
2. **Missing Backend**: Amplify is only serving static files from `dist/public/`, not running the Node.js server
3. **API Routes Not Available**: All `/api/*` endpoints return 404 because there's no server running

## Root Cause üéØ

AWS Amplify is treating this as a **static site deployment** instead of a **full-stack application**. The backend server (`dist/index.js`) is built but not running.

## Solutions üìã

### Option 1: Switch to AWS Lambda/API Gateway (Recommended)
AWS Amplify doesn't natively support Express.js servers. You need to:

1. **Convert Express routes to Lambda functions**
2. **Use AWS API Gateway** for routing
3. **Deploy frontend to Amplify, backend to Lambda**

### Option 2: Use Different Deployment Platform
Deploy to platforms that support full-stack Node.js:

- **Vercel** (supports serverless functions)
- **Netlify** (supports serverless functions)  
- **Railway** (supports full Node.js apps)
- **Render** (supports full Node.js apps)
- **Heroku** (supports full Node.js apps)

### Option 3: Serverless Architecture Conversion
Convert the Express.js app to serverless functions:

```bash
# Install serverless framework
npm install -g serverless

# Convert routes to Lambda functions
# /api/webhook-proxy -> webhook-proxy.js function
# /api/webhook-status -> webhook-status.js function
```

## Immediate Fix for AWS Amplify üõ†Ô∏è

Since AWS Amplify doesn't run Node.js servers, I'll create a serverless-compatible version:

### 1. Create Lambda Functions
Each API route becomes a separate Lambda function

### 2. Update amplify.yml
Configure for serverless deployment

### 3. Add API Gateway Configuration
Route API calls to Lambda functions

## Current Status Summary

**Replit Environment ‚úÖ**
- Backend server runs correctly
- API endpoints work
- Webhook proxy functional (gets 524 timeout, but n8n receives data)

**AWS Amplify Environment ‚ùå**  
- Only static frontend deployed
- No backend server running
- All API calls return 404

## Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment strategy** (Lambda conversion or different platform)
2. **Implement serverless architecture** for AWS compatibility
3. **Or migrate to Node.js-friendly platform** like Vercel/Railway

Would you like me to:
- Convert to AWS Lambda functions? 
- Prepare deployment for Vercel/Railway?
- Keep current architecture and deploy elsewhere?
